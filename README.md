# PIG-Game 🎊 🎊 🎈
Pig game from Jonas Schmedtmann Js tutorial

## GAME RULES 🤩⭐

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 20 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

## Features to implement 💡🤔
- [ ] If the user clicks on hold by mistake before rolling the dice then the games would alert the player of the error and have a chance to roll the dice.
- [ ] Laderboard where the overall best player would be displayed in the page for Scores.
- [ ] Players can login into sessions to see thier personal records and achievements.
- [ ] I may implement 2 dice.
- [ ] A player loses his score when they roll two 6, then it is the next player's turn to roll the dice
- [ ] Implement a feature where the players can set the score for winning. Example I may change the Score that make me a winner @ 20 to 40 .
- [ ] Make the game responsive on mobile
